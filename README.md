> [!NOTE]
> This is the fork of the [original rounded-window-corners extension](https://github.com/yilozt/rounded-window-corners) by @yilozt, which is no longer maintained.

## PaperWM compatibility

Window rounding is applied to Mutter's surface before PaperWM's monitor clipping,
and custom shadows follow PaperWM's scrolling clones. Surface selection is
independent of child order, so Blur My Shell's background layer does not replace
the app surface as the rounding target. Application blur remains available to
PaperWM's clones during scrolling; Blur My Shell retains control of its blur
pipeline and settings.

Validated on GNOME Shell 50.5 with PaperWM 50.0.1 and Blur My Shell 72. See
[tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for regression coverage and the manual test
matrix, including cases that still need verification.

## Installation

### From Gnome Extensions

The extension is available on [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org). You can install it directly [from here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7048/rounded-window-corners-reborn/), or from the Extension Manager app.

### From pre-built archives

If you want to install the latest commit of the extension, you can get a
pre-built archive from GitHub Actions.

2. Go to [the build action page](https://github.com/flexagoon/rounded-window-corners/actions/workflows/build.yml)
3. Click on the latest workflow run
4. Download the extension from the "artifacts" section at the bottom
5. Install it with the `gnome-extensions install` command

### From source code
